# Explanation:
# The line `*.exe` in a `.gitignore` file is correct for ignoring all files with the `.exe` extension in your repository.
# However, the use of `//` for comments is incorrect in `.gitignore` files.
# In `.gitignore`, comments should start with `#`, not `//`.
# 
# What is wrong:
# - Using `//` for comments is not recognized by `.gitignore` and may cause issues.
# 
# What is happening:
# - The line `*.exe` will work, but the `// Start of Selection` and `// End of Selection` lines will not be treated as comments by `.gitignore`.
# 
# Ways to fix:
# - Replace `//` with `#` for comments in `.gitignore`.
# 
# Fixed code:

# Start of Selection
*.exe
# End of Selection.
